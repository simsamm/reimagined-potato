# The Code Challenge Fall 2018

This is the first step, and the most fun, in the application – The Coding Challenge. 

## The brief

This is your chance to make your personal mark on one of the most used web services out there today: GOOGLE. We want you to re-build the front, meaning how it looks like NOT any functionality. Style it however you like, go crazy bold or a do it more minimalistic - the important thing is that you have fun doing it! And hopefully learn something new in the process.

## Requirements
Your solution must contain:
* An image.
* A button.
* An input field.

We don't expect a masterpiece, we expect you to spend about four hours on this assignment. If you haven't coded before we think you might have to add an hour or two to read some of the suggested reading material.


### Why a coding challenge?
We know that all of you are beginners at programming - we will not judge your solution based on the quality of your code or amount of work. We do however want to see that you’ve touched on a bit of programming before and know what you’re getting yourself into.

Make sure to have fun during the process! Do something that you find interesting and motivating.

## How to complete this assignment

1. Start by sketching with pen and paper how you want your version of Google's login page to look like.
1. Structure your work. Break down your solution in smaller blocks. Estimate how long each block will take to build. Does it sound reasonable to finish? If yes, move on to the next step. If not, go back to step 1 and revise your scope.
1. Download or clone this repository with templates and start coding.

### Download the code files

We have given you a little head start. If you download all files from this project to your computer you will find a `code` folder. The code folder contains of two files, a `index.html` file and a `style.css` file. The most simple approach is to download a code editor and open them in, for example [Atom](https://atom.io/).

In Atom you edit the files. After saving them you can click on the `index.html` file to open it in a web browser to see your webpage take shape. Then you should be all set – happy coding!

### Hand in the assignment

Hand in the assignment by:
* Create an account on Github.com
* Start a new repository or project, make sure it's public.
* [Upload](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-file-to-a-repository/) your whole code folder.
* Attach the link to the repository in your [written application.](https://technigo.typeform.com/to/WYgUEV)

Good luck!

### How you will be judged
The coding assignment will be judged by a jury from the industry. All solutions will be anonymously judged, and what we will be looking for is your solution in relation to your previous knowledge – no need to panic!

### :books: Readings

If you haven't coded before we suggest these resources to get you started, but feel free to Google!  

* [What is HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
* [Getting started with HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Getting_started)
* [How CSS works](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/How_CSS_works)

### :sos: How to get help
Learning how to think as a web developer is learning how to be an expert in problem solving. Google will very much be you friend in this! Try searching for your questions on Google or for example in an online development community like [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) .

If you need help with the code challenge or just want to visit our studio - we arrange an open house on May 3rd. If you would like to participate, read more and sign up on [the Event Site ](https://try-our-boot-camp.confetti.events/?__s=vyhfce5ozsxgixv1xmkr)

### :boom: Success!

After completing this challenge we hope that you will understand more what programming is and if it's for you. You will also gain some knowledge in two of the biggest programming languages, HTML and CSS. But most of all, we hope you had fun!

### :runner: Stretch Goals

If you managed to do everything super quickly and can't get enough of coding, here's some suggestions of what you can add. TOTALLY optional.

1. Use a custom font using [Google fonts.](https://fonts.google.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=1001467%20%7C%20Material.IO%20%7C%20Global%20%7C%20en%20%7C%20Hybrid%20%7C%20Text%20%7C%20BKWS&utm_term=%7Bkeyword%7D&gclid=EAIaIQobChMItcCyxeaG2AIVwbYYCh3OtgmsEAAYASAAEgJ6O_D_BwE)
2. Make the page responsive and look differently on mobile than desktop.
